# Project-Boat-Company-

THE FINAL PRODUCT IS: CLASS SOLUTIONS(version 2)

A boat company has approached you. They want you to make a program that keeps track on the amount of boats it has in the harbour. 
The boats on the harbour have different colors.
There are red boats, blue boats, and yellow boats,
This company charges $20 per hour when a customer rents a boat.

#COMMENTS ON Class solution
 I realised that there was an easier way to store data about the different boats with classes.


#COMMENTS ON Class solution(version 2)

 there was a need to reduce a lot of code from verion 1
 there was also a need for the program to be specific in the questions it asked the user
 i had to add a feature where the user can put in the individual colours and the amount of hours on each boat.
 there had to be a way to display the costs of the individual boats and display the total.
 I needed to make the output more presentable
 
 #PROBLEMS FACED 
  
  I tried storing values in a list but i kept getting NoneType errors!
  The logic that the program had to follow took a lot of time to draw up (a lot of paper and ink wasted)
  It took some time to only focus on the important features of the program. A lot of the features I had written had to be removed to      suit   the customers specifications.
  
  #WHAT I REALISED 
  
  When  focusing on projects its important to write code that suits the customers specifications
  Start by programming a skeleton of the program. Once you have a basic idea of what you have to do, find was to improve your code.
  There are online resources that can help you understand features in Python.
